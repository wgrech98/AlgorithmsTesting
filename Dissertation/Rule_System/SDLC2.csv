3. Flexibility to allow dev teams to easily pivot to other tasks to focus on as needed
4. Ease of use/complexity of method chosen, to not disincentivize devs from properly using system or hinder productivity
5. Problems with current method employed (as in, if Company X is using SDLC Method Y, and does not seem to be having major issues, this would greatly affect choice, or lack thereof, of new method) ",
